A repository showcasing some of my work, where I develop solutions to novel physics problems encountered during extracurricular lab work, final projects, or research for the sake of research.

### Charge accumulation on a coil

Simulated the whole system of a magnetic pendulus swinging over a coil. From the swinging to modeling the
magnet as a dipole and integrating the equations on the surface. Below the video there is a graph showing the predicted
current, where there is a third peak which happens because of charge accumulation. This third peak is achieved by considering
the self-inductance and capacity of the wires while they carry the magnet's energy.

### Glow experiment with Helium and Air

Analyzed the Spectrum of Helium and found a mismatch between the measured data and the one tabulated at the NIST institute. Every frequency was shifted to longer wavelengths (reminiscent of red-shifts).
Explained the mismatch by proposing thermic doppler effects, and with the theory calculating the temperature of electrons in the gas, 
coinciding with other papers in the field.

### Song of the Quet Zal

This is a poster that showcases a physical model derived for the pyramid of Chichen Itza sound effect, where a person applauds in front of the staircase and the reflection of the sound, sounds like the chant of the regional bird "Quet-Zal".
By considering a spherical wave and assuming certain dimensions for the applauder, we can use the known dimensions of the pyramid to derive a model for the reflection of the wave packet emmited from the hands.

(More details on the poster)

We limit the study to just the reflection of the stairs because of many unknown parameters for the other parts of the structure and the low sound quality in the recordings used. The simulation was able to reproduce the main frequencies and it's harmonics, returning a sound which goes from high to low frequencies in delay.

### Quantum decoherence

For the Quantum Open systems course final, a simulation on quantum decoherence was based on the well known paper of Jasper Van Wessel and Jeroen van den Brink.

These simulations reproduce the claims of the paper, the mathematics and code are discussed on the powerpoint presentation. Alongside this, there's 
a code showcase of QuTip, calculating quantum de-coherence in 3D using a wigner function, shannon entropy and Lindblad equations.
