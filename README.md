A Repo for showcasing some of my works in analyzing physics experiments.

### Induced current on a coil

Simulated the whole system of a magnetic pendulus swinging over a coil.

### Glow experiment with Helium and Air

Analyzed the Spectrum of Helium and found a mismatch between the measured data and the 
one tabulated at the NIST institute. Explained the mismatch by proposing thermic doppler effects,
and with the theory calculating the temperature of electrons in the gas, coinciding with other
papers in the field.

### Machine learning on depleting population

In Argentina, since 2016 there has been a fall in the national birth rate. The project investigates
specifically this phenomenon and shows that the drop is seen for every province, and that some cities
lagged behind in this trend before sticking to it. A Random Forest Regressor is trained with all of the
data from the provinces except "Buenos Aires" and then used to predict the birth rate of the province.

### Song of the Quet Zal
This is a poster that showcases a physical model devised for the kukulcan sound effect, where a person applauds in 
front of the staircase and the reflection of the sound, sounds like the chant of the regional bird "Quet-Zal".
