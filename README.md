A Repo for showcasing some of my works in analyzing physics experiments.

### Charge accumulation on a coil

Simulated the whole system of a magnetic pendulus swinging over a coil. From the swinging to modeling the
magnet as a dipole and integrating the equations on the surface. Below the video there is a graph showing the predicted
current, where there is a third peak which happens because of charge accumulation. This third peak is achieved by considering
the self-inductance and capacity of the wires while they carry the magnet's energy.

### Glow experiment with Helium and Air

Analyzed the Spectrum of Helium and found a mismatch between the measured data and the 
one tabulated at the NIST institute. Explained the mismatch by proposing thermic doppler effects,
and with the theory calculating the temperature of electrons in the gas, coinciding with other
papers in the field.

### Song of the Quet Zal

This is a poster that showcases a physical model devised for the kukulcan sound effect, where a person applauds in 
front of the staircase and the reflection of the sound, sounds like the chant of the regional bird "Quet-Zal".

### Quantum decoherence

For the Quantum Open systems course final, a simulation on quantum decoherence was based on the well known paper of Jasper Van Wessel and Jeroen van den Brink. 

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/1894264_Spontaneous_Symmetry_Breaking_and_Decoherence_in_Superconductors]

These simulations reproduce the claims of the paper and the mathematics and code are discussed on the powerpoint presentation. Alongside this, there's 
a code showcase of QuTip, calculating quantum de-coherence in 3D using a wigner function, shannon entropy and Lindblad equations.
