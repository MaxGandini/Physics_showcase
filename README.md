A Repo for showcasing some of my works in analyzing physics experiments.

### Charge accumulation on a coil

Simulated the whole system of a magnetic pendulus swinging over a coil. From the swinging to modeling the
magnet as a dipole and integrating the equations on the surface. Below the video there is a graph showing the predicted
current, where there is a third peak which happens because of charge accumulation. This third peak is achieved by considering
the self-inductance and capacity of the wires while they carry the magnet's energy.

### Clustering on Crime centers

A study about the relationship of nightclubs to crime in CABA was made. It was found that using a K-means cluster
and two datasets from the open database of the city, one can isolate clusters of crime which happen on the same
blocks as nightclubs. This explains the majority of crimes commited in the relevant time-frame.

### Machine learning on depleting population

In Argentina, since 2016 there has been a fall in the national birth rate. The project investigates
specifically this phenomenon and shows that the drop is seen for every province, and that some cities
lagged behind in this trend before sticking to it. A Random Forest Regressor is trained with all of the
data from the provinces except "Buenos Aires" and then used to predict the birth rate of the province.

### Glow experiment with Helium and Air

Analyzed the Spectrum of Helium and found a mismatch between the measured data and the 
one tabulated at the NIST institute. Explained the mismatch by proposing thermic doppler effects,
and with the theory calculating the temperature of electrons in the gas, coinciding with other
papers in the field.

### Song of the Quet Zal
This is a poster that showcases a physical model devised for the kukulcan sound effect, where a person applauds in 
front of the staircase and the reflection of the sound, sounds like the chant of the regional bird "Quet-Zal".
